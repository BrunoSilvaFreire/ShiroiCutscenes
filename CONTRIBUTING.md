# Submitting changes

All changes should be sent as a GitHub Pull Request with a description of everything you've changed. Please follow our coding conventions when doing so!  

Everyone loves descriptions, so please include one in your commits, we don't mind if it's too short or too long, every commit message gets some love here! 
# Style Guide
We make use of [Microsoft's C# style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions) with a few modifications:  
* Brackets should be placed on the end of the line instead of a new line.  

And that's pretty much it, happy coding!
