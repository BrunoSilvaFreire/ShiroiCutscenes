# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Shiroi Cutscenes
We are a very casual community, we don't care as much about formalities, hierarchy or other related things.
We are all civilized game developers and have very simple values:
* Use common sense
* Don't use excessive swearing on project related discussions and topics, we don't mind a word here or there, just don't make it the majority of your message.
* Respect each other, again, use common sense, and don't do: personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.
* Don't propagate hate, which means: no racism, sexism, xenophobia or any other kind of hate  

Any contributor who violates these rules will have action taken against by the maintainers of this project.
